## Contributing to Bolt
If you have found yourself here, then thanks for your interest in contributing to Bolt! It really means a lot that you have that level of interest in this project.

### Getting started
Bolt is currently in its infancy, and as such I'm making heavy changes fairly constantly which in turn means the repo is in a heavy state of flux. This doesn't mean contributions aren't welcome though! However, it might mean that there is a little but of turbulance in making a contribution.

If you plan to contribute by fixing bugs, implementing aspects of the compiler or standard library, you should really make sure you can build the project locally.

### How to contribute?
There are a few types of contribution that would be massively helpful...

1. Raise issues about bugs, issues, missing features. Of course in these early days a lot of things are going to be missing. Raising an issue about not being able to add two integers together is probably not a useful bug report as its almost certainly going to be done. But perhaps you've found a scenario in which you expected an error to be raised but wasn't? Or an error was raised when shouldn't be?

2. Fix existing bugs and issues. If you're feeling more adventurous then perhaps you might want to try fixing some existing issues? If so then fork the repository and create a branch with your fix. Pull requests with fixes and contributions are welcomed.

3. Code reviews. If there are open pull requests in the project, even draft's, then take a look through the diff. If you spot any issues then mention them. The author may already be aware or may not. A second or third set of eyes never hurt anyone!

### Style guides
The project currently has no style guide, other than how code has already been written. Unless you have a proposal for changes to the style guide (or even adding one), your contributions should try to follow the style.
